I am a Clinical Informatics Ph.D. student and a National Library of Medicine (NLM) Fellow in the Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology (DMICE) at OHSU. Before starting the Ph.D. program in clinical informatics, I worked as a certified clinical research professional, managing and coordinating clinical trials in oncology and bone marrow transplant. I am interested in the secondary uses of EHR data and building and integrating clinical decision support systems to improve patient safety. My current interest involves clinical decision support for opioid prescription.
